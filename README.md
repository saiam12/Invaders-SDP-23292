# 🚀 Space Game Project

## 🧭 Overview
This project is a space shooting game developed using **Java** (and **Python** for AI mode).  
The development follows the **Gitflow workflow** and applies **Agile methodology** using **Scrum** and **Kanban**.  
Sprint progress and task tracking are managed through **Jira**.

---

## ⚙️ Development Workflow

- **Version Control:** Gitflow branching strategy
    - `main` – stable releases
    - `develop` – integration branch
    - `feature/*` – individual feature branches

- **Agile Process:** Scrum + Kanban
    - Sprint-based development
    - Task tracking and progress sharing via **Jira**
    - Continuous review and iteration

---

## 🧩 Features & Development Plan

### 1. Single / Multi Mode Selection
- Implement mode selection screen
- Add **Single Mode** and **Multiplayer Mode** logic

---

### 2. Enemy HP System
- Change color based on HP for regular enemies
- Display HP bar for bosses
- Adjust **bomb collision logic** to prevent overlapping
- Fix **bullet hit detection** logic

---

### 3. Shop Stage Update
- Fix bug where no items appear in stage 1
- Implement **sequential shop upgrades** by stage
- Reset shop stage and money on death, but keep **skin points**

---

### 4. Simple Story Feature
- Display story window at the start of each stage
- Allow skipping with **Spacebar**

---

### 5. Login System
- Create login window
- Save and load user account information

---

### 6. Spaceship Skins
- Add **skin purchase** and **selection** interface
- Create skin assets
- Implement **skin points** (earned as total money / 10)

---

### 7. Infinite Mode
- Enemy HP increases over time
- Add **mode selection screen** (Single / Infinite)
- Introduce **varied or randomized formations**
- Spawn **bosses periodically**
- Implement **infinite mode ranking/record system**

---

### 8. AI Mode
> **Highest priority feature**

#### 🧠 API Specification (to be defined first)
- **Action:** move up, down, left, right, shoot
- **State:**
    - Player ship (x, y, cooldown, speed)
    - Enemy ships and bullets
    - Items
    - Player bullets (x, y, penetration count)
    - Score

#### ☕ Java Side
- Implement **HTTP communication module**
- Connect API calls within the **core game loop**
- Add **AI Mode** selection button

#### 🐍 Python Side
- Implement **Reinforcement Learning algorithm**
- Build **Python API server**
- Write `run_server.py` script to launch API server

---

### 9. Balance Adjustment (optional)
- Tune enemy stats, item effects, and difficulty scaling
